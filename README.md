# Videos App


The application is written in React (functional components with Hooks). Initiated with create-react-app CLI. With this application you can search for videos on a specific topic (there is an input field for the word by which the search is carried out). The application communicates with  YouTube API and displays the appropriate videos on the screen (one of them - on the main screen, and 4 others - on the additional sidebar).
